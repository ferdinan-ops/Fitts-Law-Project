# Fitts Law Game
<p>Fitts's law is a model of speed-accuracy tradeoffs used in human–computer interaction and ergonomics. It  predicts time required to acquire a target on screen as a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target. Fitts's law is used to model the act of pointing, either by physically touching an object with a hand,finger or virtually  or  by pointing to an object on a computer monitor using a pointing device. It was proposed by Paul Fitts in 1954.</p>

<h2>Physical interpretation and application of Fitts’s Law </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Big targets at close distance are acquired faster than small targets at long range.</li>
    <li>Target  acquiring difficulty increases by one unit for each doubling of  distance  and halving of width  of  target.</li>
    <li>Fitts's Law can be used  to evaluate  alternative interaction methods in Graphical User Interface (GUI).</li>
    <li>It can also be used to predict the performance of operators in user-adaptive systems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I used</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>Language:</b> Visual Basic.</li>
  <li><b>IDE:</b> Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.</li>
  <li><b>Framework:</b> GUNA UI.</li>
  <li><b>Pictures:</b> Pinterest, Dribble, Freepik, Flaticon.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ol>
    <li>You will observe the effect of target distance and target size on the GUI target selection time.</li>
    <li>You  can  apply  fitt's  law  in designing  and placing widgets on computer interface.</li>
</ol>
